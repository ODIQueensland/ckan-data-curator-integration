# Test data

Most test data will be sourced from https://github.com/frictionlessdata/example-data-packages

If extra test data is needed, it will be stored in this directory.

Each [feature request](https://github.com/ODIQueensland/ckan-data-curator-integration/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Af%3AFeature-request) will contain links to the required test data.
